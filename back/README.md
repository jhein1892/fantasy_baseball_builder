# Backend for Fantasy Baseball projects
I'm hoping that this backend is going to be python based, allowing me to utilize ML to analyze matchups with roster availability to create the best fantasy lineup available for your team.

## Feature List:
1) Determine best options for the week
2) Estimate the amount of points per category that your team will get
3) Determine the chance of winning the week
4) See if there are any free agents that would be good additions to your team.

## To Run
Once you've installed all the dependent python packages, run the command:

    app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
